Black Thought
Yo, head lost, sipping this Lambic Framboise
Spitting it for like whoever demand the answer
Whats the cure for this hip-hop cancer? Equivalent
To this avalanche of black snow, rap flow
To get my people thinkin mo, we at the brink of war
What does it all mean? Whats it all for?
With knowledge of yourself, then youre through the first door
My people hungry and thirst for more next music explore
Its heavenly to your ebony daughter next door
So what you think The Roots get the world respect for?
The splendid authentic hip-hop thats raw core
Severe, world premier, a superior sophomore
No doubt, wherever you dwell, thats where the bomb fell
Explodin from the imperial ensemble, for real
From the ven-ue to the avenue
We truly only got respect for a few, yall aint sayin nutting new
