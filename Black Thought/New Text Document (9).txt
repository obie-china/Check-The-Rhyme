Black Thought
Lost generation, fast paced nation
World population confront their frustration
The principles of true hip-hop have been forsaken
Its all contractual and about money making
Pretend-to-be cats dont seem to know they limitation
Exact replication and false representation
You wanna be a man, then stand your own
To M C requires skills, I demand some shown
I let the frauds keep fronting and roam like a cellular phone
Far from home giving crowds what they wanting
Official hip-hop consumption, the 5th thumping
Keeping your party jumping with an original something
Yo, I dedicate this to the one-dimensional
No imagination, excuse for perpetration
My man came over and said: "Yo we thought we heard you"
Jokes on you; you heard a biting-ass crew but um
