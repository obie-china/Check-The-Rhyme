Black Thought
Check it out
While you pose for pictures, I the invisible enigma
Down low, scope you off the roof like the fiddler
Cage you up in the vocal booth, youre held prisoner
Watch, while I banging out this hot shit from Sigma
Illa-del-P-A, live without a D J
And its been that way, since Sergio Vallente
Yo, The Roots holding it down, is all you can say
Plus the Black Thought em-cey, professional-lay
Push pen to paper like Chinua Achebe
Thumping, what was your assumption
I lace your function, make it a Black Thought production
Word up I on something, stellar hold off course
I gone blunting, travel light and broadcast
Via satellite, Illa-Fifth Dynamite
Lyrically calculus in this arithmetic hip-hop metropolis
But loyal fiends copping this hot shit
Yaknahmsayin, hot shit, word up
Illa-Fifth hot shit yall
