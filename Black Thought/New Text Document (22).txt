Black Thought
Yo, one, two, one-two one-two
Thats how we usually start, once again its the Thought
The Dalai Lama of the mike, the prime minister Thought
This directed to whoever in listening range
Yo the whole state of things in the world bout to change
Black rain falling from the sky look strange
The ghetto is red hot, we stepping on flames
Yo, its inflation on the price for fame
And it was all the same, but then the antidote came
The Black Thought, ill syllablist, out the Fifth
This heavyweight rap shit I about to lift
Like, a phyllum lift up its seed to sunlight
I plug in the mic, draw like a gunfight
I never use a cordless, or stand applaudless
Sipping cholorophyll out of ill silver goblets
I like a faucet, monopolys the object
There aint no way to cut this tap, you got ta get wet
Your head is throbbing and I aint said shit yet
