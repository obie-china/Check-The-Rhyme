Black Thought
Ghetto related with this hit the whole world awaited
Yall Dorito-head cats that yak and stagnated
Black Thought, The Doug E. Most war veteran
Crown ruler, soul controller of this lyrical land
Spliff wizard kid, who is it?
Fifth Dinosaur Ghetto, beat detonator
Apex my level, NEXT, my complex pattern of speech is like sex
I mastered the art of making you snap the necks
And Chase Manhattan endorse my mike checks
Upset, poet threat
Just collecting my debt, yo I overpaid in dues
Blood tears and sweat, when you fucking with The Roots
Thats as good as it get, Ultramagnet
We pull you in a Drag-net then brainwash your click
And extort your assets, then roadie all your homies
On some old school shit, Roots crew represent
