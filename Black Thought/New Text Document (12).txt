Black Thought
Yo, in the glow of the moon, over the melancholy metro
My poetry is set like a U.F.O
The maestro, the lyricist concerto
My physical play the role of a vessel
The level of my lyrics law manifesto
My thoughts wrestle and attack with the killer instincts
Of a gorilla stronger than Samson
Without Delilah, my soliloquy profess my ability to just
Stimulate you like the best sensimilla
The Halflife of Illadel' L P, no filler, proceed
Hithering is my death, I will blow your tower to smithe-
-reens, the fiends catch another rhyme river
Deeper than the meditations of a Hindu worshiper
Unorthodox hip-hop minister
Than a Serengeti cheetah, my thoughts swifter
You lose your balance when the sound hits ya
So, check for the Fifth Militia
A poets under pressure, stressing that you get the picture
Even if it mean you gotta hang over the banister
I pull a microphone on any pistol brandisher
And take advantage of ya crew because youre amateur
Styles gunning down your sound-man and manager, what
This how we do it in the year of ninety six
With this deliberate attack on pointless rap shit
Breaking M C down to fraction, tell your squadron
Its time to go to war, Respond React once more
