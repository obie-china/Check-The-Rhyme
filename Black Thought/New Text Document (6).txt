Black Thought
At times, I feel as if could pull a kamikaze
Illuminati rally in the Civic Center lobby
They seeds in the world student body
Probably creating missiles, they got my child holding pistols
Knowledge and understand will make a man murder
Stand further, fuck all the swine plus the hamburger
No hallucinant, the Lieutenant plus Militant
Aryan murder, thats mental
Credentials is I am a Hell residential
With fire for the presidential
Eventually, its havoc in the temple
I terrorize the heavens
Bring on the renaissance with the sevens and civilize the reverence
Reprimand the deacon, keeping him from speaking
Tell him cease the false preaching
I step like a shadow on the way to hot concrete
And observe my peoples in the essence every weekend
We wonder, what the fuck is schools teaching?
Intoxicated soldiers in chaotic times reaching
The Dynasty is sim, but we only resemble whats grim
We attack to split your back, then we extort your specimen
I put this in your system like lecithin
Then maneuver mentally from in-ternal medicine
I hold the fort down with Malik
Symbolic to the bond of word thats Islamic
The killer forces I deposit, dealing with logic
I keep my brain on cock, it dont stop!
