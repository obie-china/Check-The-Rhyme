Black Thought
The attractive assassin, blasting the devil trespassing
Master getting cash in an orderly fashion
Message to the fake nigga flashing
Slow up Ock, before you get dropped and closed like a caption
Fractional kids dont know the time for action
Styles got the rhythm that of an Anglo-Saxon
Round of applause, an avalanche of clapping
thats what happen, now whats your reaction
We heavyweight traction, pro-pornographing
Specialize in science and math and, original black man
Busting thoughts that pierce your mental
The fierce rippin your sacks and
Vocal toe to toe impeccable splitting your back son
Simple as addition and subtraction
Black Thought, the infinite relaxed one
Shorties say they love it with a passion
Bring the international charm, see a squad I harass
