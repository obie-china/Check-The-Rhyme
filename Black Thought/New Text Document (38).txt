Black Thought
Yo yall savages is primitive, I true penmanship
Here come the neuro-linguistic rap hypnotist
Making sound waves, prisoners outta the listeners
Legendary magnificent dope distributors
Man, I remain miles ahead of the game
Slang play off the meter cause its never the same
Niggas tell me how they never coming better than plain
They love what I say, here come the rebel breaking the frame
And the charts too, my earning bars arts is martial
I coming to off you, I aint tryin to argue
When you least expect it I gonna step out the darkroom
Pull out the hardware tools the particles will spark you
My niggas wraps give a slice, I spit nice
Fucking around this twice as much as rhythm is rolling a dice
To choose one the noose or the gun
Cause youre getting banged or hanged, Thought second to none
Nigga
