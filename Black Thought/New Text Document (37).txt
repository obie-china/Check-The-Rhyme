Black Thought
Ayo yall rappers less played, what I about to say
Will probably hit yall niggas in a real strange way
Shmucks, ducks and half hearted prankster crews
Willie dank Langston Hughes, put shanks in crews
I debut to make the news and Ive been killing it since
Still in the trench, buzzing off the chillest suspense
I want my niggas out that barbwire still in the fence
Verbal assassin I a killer still in a sense
Rhymes is graphic
Aiming straight at your minds and blast that weak shit
The pieces and particles of fragments
Mad vocabulist, yes I must confess
I like Diddy trying to sink a slug in Elliots chest
Just taste on that its Black you can tell he a vet
You never knew that fate cut you until your belly was wet
New Delian cat the Fraggle Rock skully is split
Its Black coming, you can tell its a hit
Comin to drop you nigga
