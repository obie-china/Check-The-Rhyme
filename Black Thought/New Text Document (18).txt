Black Thought
Who knows what you snorted?
Or who support what you recorded?
But dont get it distorted, in this orbit youre aborted
This authentic, sorted shits imported, exported
Styles, they get sported, my paragraphs aortic

Slice tongues from your area code
Student of life thats on the rugged, exterior mode
Blind a devil with the bold, black and gold shine
I walk the thin line and hold mine, let the people respond
Its mind detect mind, swine decline, let the power refine
Build like its ninety ninety nine
In this day and time, the reptilian roams the sextillion tons
Your Armageddon gwan come from the sun
Untouchable cuts thats unclutchable for some to overstand
So yall sit back and wonder "damn!"
I like to take this time to tell you who I am
