Black Thought
Yo, just push the panic button on your remote control
Then enter the zone where I patrol this wicked realm cold soul
Diddly Bo, leave her feeling a saga foretold
Who got caught 'pon the block for gold, got the old heads froze
They peeping outta closed windows
They not secure as they supposed, I watched it all unfold
Witness another episode, with titanic panoramic view
As this manic-depressant un-load with this gung-ho
Wild like a son sold for cash
Guns traded for sensi and hash, crack for ass
Entire crews pass, not making the news flash
Brews pass a memory and spark not to blast
Whatever Av transform to the war path
Pure wrath from North down to twenty fourth and Task
Game slaughter half the niggas you acquainted with
Streets tainted with camouflage, guerilla sabotage
My cousins Jarette and Todd was living type large
Got caught then blast, crashed off on Broad and Lombard
So many so-called hearts scarred, they buried in the yard
Lick shots at Babylon, de one comfy bombard
Kids run far from traditional credit cards scams
Veterans is nipped in the butt with large plans
Stick-up kids is jumping outta plated Dodge Rams
To jam you and your man, its mad drama and
