Black Thought
Yall know the dynasty, the Roots repertoire
The lieutenant from the reservoir, serve the spar
The injurer, predator of a competitor
I send M C where the paramedics are
At first, I like "nah", I nonchalant from afar
Then strike to cut the fake rap star jugular
With irregular balance of the cat burgalar
Known to parlay with Garcia Vega cigars
I know the flavor because me and the thugs minds are mutual
We congruent, lay on the corner with the traum' unit
I from the lab where the bombs distributed
So never try to duplicate the skills executed
Son youd get electrocuted from the worldwide reputed
Shine like nickel heat that blow your mind when I shoot it
Some know me as the man thats from the Roots crew
Others as the bad lieutenant of Snyder Avenue
We go an eye for an eye
Behead like a samurai thatll command the dynasty until he die
Who will imply that I lack ability?
Make your words known, amplify the utility
I crooked like the 'I' on a toxic malt liquor
The land whipper, the Dom Perignon champ sipper
The fifthll bring it all together like the zipper on a butter leather
The bad lieu a bring the bad weather
So to whoever got riff, let it rest
Reflect, then recollect on the way it was set
Its the veteran architect that flows with the rhythm of sex
Be on the low, shotgun in the Lex
So with my man, low to flex
I resting' where they handle the Tecs
And the lyrical vandal is next the flow
So, my man, my MZA, my man
M-ilitant, whats the master plan?
Once again
