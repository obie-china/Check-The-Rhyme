Black Thought
Mesmerizing, state of the art caffeine
Its over head like Omniverse screen
I not the average savage that curse queens
I something from his worst dreams
First we handling first things, I subsurface unseen
Gratll hold planet by purse strings
M C are earthlings, not built to hurt things
Speaking the words of weaklings, nothing but sweet things
