Black Thought
Yo check it out whether you balling or just on the
Wall and grooving grooving
Weve come to get it kicking and get the movement movin
For Tracey and Tamika and for Shelly and Susan
Styles make you wonder what the hell he was usin
Remember your development with melanin music
Spit so many spears its becoming a nuisance to some
But to whoever want to know who the truth is
You never heard another on the mike as ruthless
I drink a little liquor a lot of water and juices
It make money aint no need for making excuses
Burn you fucking with a South Philly exclusive
Them long dick niggas with real short fuses that go off
Chick likes Riq, you such a show off
You cut your locks down to a fro then cut your fro off
I been at your show there aint no way to cut your flow off
You got to be the illest emcee that people know of word
