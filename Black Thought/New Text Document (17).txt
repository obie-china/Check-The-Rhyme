Black Thought
Dig it, look into the window, tell me what you see?
Lieutenant university of philosophy
When you not possibly escaping what I meditating
My shackle of thought tackle you while I educating
Your domes resonating from inhalation of darkness
As I spark the smart shit for which youre waiting
Situating me at the top of the pile
Wild Delaware Val, Pennsylvanian, sub-terranean style
Step up into my crevice and taste the medicine of the champagne
King like Evelyn, leaving you leveled and sabotaged
Its all camouflage like the devil and guns
And coke peddling, Olympic meddling flashback
That of a war veteran blast at
The programmer bringing lashes 'cross your back
On some accuracy of a brainwashed Bosnian troop
That swooped down through your roof without sound
On a lyrical Nat Turner mission, reacting off of intuition
Continuously alert, no intermission
If your ears hurt, you shouldnt listen
That means youre artificial and my stylell poison your brain tissue
Getting maimed and crippled once the gamma rays hit you
Migraines habitual and I should never go against
The ritual Ive been mastering ever since
I was among the flavored youth, remain sharper than a saber tooth
My deliverance is self-evidence
Vit-al, lyric-al science
