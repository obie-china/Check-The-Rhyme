Black Thought
Yo, enter the last era
Your scholarship into the world of politics and mascara
We operate within this artificial op-era
I bring hip-hop terror like the FÃ¼hrer
The Ace Ventura into the horror
Laboratory labor-er, venture beyond the border
I struc-ture a style, destroy your whole aura
Plus, your adrenalinll rise before your eyes
Immortalize my image in the skies
Deceive the devil in disguise
My music I parenthesize, represent the wise
Through this be how we enterprise
Kid, no compromise I thinking fast like Rama-
Dan, I wear your mind away like Alzheimer
I pull a mike up out my mama, big up to Bahama-
Dia, ayyo, this year we leaving 'em in trauma
Then after me, I plan to leave behind the legacy
Or history of the family, the Fifth Dynasty
For humanity to bear witness to this
