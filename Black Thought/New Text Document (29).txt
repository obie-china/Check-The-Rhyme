Black Thought
The anticipation arose as time froze
I stared off the stage with my eyes closed and dove
Into the deep cosmos, the impact
Pushed back, the first five rows, but before the raw
Live shows, I remember I a little snot-nosed
Rocking Cazal goggles and Izod clothes
Learning the ropes of ghetto survival
Peeping out the situation I had to slide through
Had to watch my back, my front, plus my sides too
When it came to getting mine I aint trying to argue
Sometimes I wouldn'ta made it if it wasnt for you
Hip-hop, you the love of my life and thats true
When I was handling the shit I had to do
It was all for you, from the door for you
Speak through you, getting paper on tour for you
From the start, Thought was down by law for you
Used to hit up every corner store wall for you
We ripped shit and kept it hardcore for you
I remember late nights, steady rocking the mike
Hip-hop you the love of my life, so tell the people
Like that yall, and it sounds so nice
Hip-hop, you the love of my life
We bout to take it to the top
