Black Thought
Listen, yo kick off your shoes, jump off the jock
I fly higher than them dudes, from off your block
My name Black, the style is unorthodox
It tap chins in your mens 'til you thought could box
A couple of people wanted Thought to stop, but guess what?
My man grab the missile, plug for the gut
Now next time beatty stop being such a glut
I precise with it like Faheim with haircuts
We up close on 'em with toast but no crust
Its fructose on 'em they froze and wont bust
Choke on your face you jewels is lacklust
Got to put it to you straight, yall fools is jacked up
Came close to the upmost but no cigar
Nose to the grindstone, head to the stars
The number one runner with the number one drummer
Grammy award winning its the worlds eighth wonder
Come on
