Black Thought
I woke up in the darkness at twelve seventeen to shots and sirens
Look out the window, peep the high beams
Now they searching, the cops lookin for the person
That pulled the trigger
Medical figures is nursing the kid that got shot
Some innocent ak that would front
To flip the rock on them at McKean Street block
I tried to tell him to stop cuz yo, its ghetto red hot
Similar to the blood now flooding his top
I take a step out the spot, to the point of attack
And see the shorty wop heart blast out his back
Damn, I thinking it dont cease, its no more peace
Police level increase, but what the fuck
Its still crime on the streets
I cant breathe, now whats goin on?
One minute you alive, the next, youre gone
Illadel-P-H-I-A Hell
Bust off into the heavens for the nigga who fell
And hit the L, for the niggas who fell
When that could have been prevented
In front of the flat your moms rented
And no one expect that from you, cuz you was timid
Fucking with them cats from outside city limits
Funny how this whole thing changed, an off minute
Yo, dig it, Panic!!!!!
None of this is ever granted
Drowning in a nightmare, stranded
