Black Thought
I would begin to dial her number
But knowing its been a while, its hard to link
I figure what she probably think and soon start to drink
Fighting the feeling I concealing, apparently at first appeal and
Later revealing to be deeper, resistance increasingly weaker
The essence of life is more than just mikes and puffing reefer
This universe of Black Thought that I can teach ya
I trying to touch ya, but only if I can reach ya
I hit this kid Hassan up on his beeper
And asked him if he had a chance to speak to
Jermaine Palmer, whose fathers a preacher
To make the story short, me and my man soon ran
Into each other on the humble at a show in San Fran
I said, "Yo, Palmer, when did you last see Alana?"
He offered me a seat in attempts to make me calmer
When he began to break it down, my mind start to wander
Response beyond somber
Incredibly crushed, kinda feeling on my shoulder that of a boulder
To find out that her life was over, it made the room feel colder
I thought I could get with her when she was a little older
But she a victim of the wicked system that controlled her
Its all chaotic within my life, its symbolic
Forever shadow on my mental, I never forgot it
Yo, the psychotic, The Hypnotic
Yo, check it out, the most melodic Hypnotic, yeah
