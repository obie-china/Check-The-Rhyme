Black Thought
Listen, I got you phobic off of this like arachnids
Drastic, it aint plastic its Pro-Blackness
Grown man tactics, no pediatrics
The kind of track that make the comeback miraculous
The catalyst, Thought with the knack for splashing
I dashing I mastered the craft of mashing
The level-headed thoroughbred, the females passion
Mag-netic attraction be keeping them asking
The crews in the Cadillacs with the Pendergrassin
Swerve half-naked, won't come near crashing
But if I go to heaven, would yall know my name
Or would it be the same for you like I was Eric Clapton, huh?
Clap for you freedom dog, thats whats happening
My spit take critical political action
The hustle is a puzzle each piece is a fraction
And every word thats understood is a transaction
I an S.P. soldier, microphone holder
Rep Philly set from Bolivia to Boulder
Paris, France to tenth and Tioga
How we gonna make it through the dark, I show ya
