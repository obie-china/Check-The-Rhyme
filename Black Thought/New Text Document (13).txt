Black Thought
The implorer, the universe explorer
Treat M C like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah
Leaving these niggas open like the box of Pandora
With styles thats Newer than the World Order
Approximately three quarters of yall are water, I straight deport ya
Then orchestrate your torture with roots of culture
The pilgrimage to the line of scrimmage up against your image
Where life is a heist and the strong get a percentage
Its ill as a war and within it, I the Lieutenant
That surrounds you like a peninsula to snatch the pennant
You fold like Japans futons and fans
While I design a plan to make a rapper step like a pedestrian
I crush a mount-ain into grains of sand
Your pain stains the hand that held the mic inserted to the stand
The Desperado that refuse to follow
The Fifth aficionado break you up into parts like vibrato
I deep like the dark of the night
Niggas is sweet and sound silly when they talk on the mike
They use the simple back-and-forth
The same old rhythm that's plain
I rather UltraMagnetize your brain
Its the hip-hop purist
That leave you lost like a tourist inside the chorus
Niggas is bringing nothing for us
As were breaking 'em down to fraction, tell your squadron
Its time to go to war, Respond/React once more
