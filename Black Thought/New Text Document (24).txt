Black Thought
I from the valley of the heavy-heads
Watch the ghetto pre-medical
Undergrads and steady red faces of stone
Eyes are crevices, life like a double negative
Philly criminal, I rhyme my dirt, Tariq already did
Building this Fifth foundation in the wilderness
Thought-less, trespass and enter Thoughts fortress
Limitless interest, paid to the order of the
Cypher slaughterer, my mike slapping you senseless
Defenseless, niggas never moving me inches
The beat Fifth, invisible in the trenches
Aficianado, awesome hip-hop drug problem
Fuck stardom, and chickens up in Gotham
Poltergeist, slit or choke the mike 'till it scream to me
Stop that, cash we conveniently got that
I stroll through your scenery cocked back
Me and Hot Mack, the 'ninety eight, El Dorado Cadillac Jacks
