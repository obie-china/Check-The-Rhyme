Black Thought
Word up, the formation of words to fit
Thats what I usually disturb you with
A lot of rappers never heard of this
Or know half the time it is
You doubt the Illa-Fifth, what could you accomplish?
Whether they skywriting your name, or you anonymous
You be speechless, with stinging sinuses
The Roots royal highnesses through your monitors
I tilt my crown, then blow down a diamond kiss
You need to buy a C D and stop rewinding this
I the finalist, shinign like a rugged amethyst
And at your music conference, I the panelist
Listen close to my poetry, I examine this
Like an analyst, to see if you can handle this
Check it out
You, got the groove, emcees
Freeze, stand still, nobody move
Unless you dealing with The Next Movement
The P-Phi-D we be the mon-u-ment
I live my life nice, but I not too bent
You theatrical as a Broadway play, this aint Rent
One hundred percent, straight out the Basement
Spreading this across a planet on some next shit
How many people feeling' this love music? Cmon
