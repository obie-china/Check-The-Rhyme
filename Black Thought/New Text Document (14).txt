Black Thought
I use the mike to slap you in the face and erase your taste
Disgrace your date put your title to waste
Dominant lyrical grace, from a place called wild
Illadelph Isle Pensy, thats the residency
Consistent currency, my pockets never empty
Some cats, believe they M C but we know they all fraud
Do a show in Philly niggas wouldnt applaud
Nobody know your record nor who you openin for
Can tell your squads artificial while approaching the door
So you should prepare, for lyrical terror thats pure
Step up to the resevoir, of the soul proprietor style
Messiah or, the higher law down with Dice Raw
The matador, shorty connoisseur
Stomping whatever you build to the floor
Similar to that of a dinosaur
I told you I the rap predator
You insist to imitate, what for?
Superstar niggas is ten percent real, ninety percent invented
For a fuckin record deal
Comin with somethin veterans cant feel
I hit you like a steel anvil
Because you grafted off the next mans skill
But still I remain mellow, seeing the theatrics of Othello
But know the tactics of the P.L.O
These C.L.O.-N.E.S. fess
The phoniest cats is felonious
