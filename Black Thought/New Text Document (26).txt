Black Thought
Yo, I control the stadium like the law long arm
Warn, ring the alarm, cause here The Roots come
The funks all ready for whoever want some
Your album get split like, a lump sum
No doubt, under this influencing of Falcon
Millenium spaceship, totally wasted
Schoolly D classic, though I vocally laced it
Taste this swerve on a regular basis
Servin yall wherever the place is
Blowin conniseur quality in my competitors faces
This is without doubt, your lady pass out
This Illa-Fifth Twilight Zone, you ass out
Shout, to my brothers on back route
Whipping the short thats smacked out, dig it
Strump this in your casette deck, hip-hop has not left yet
I sent a verse in the mail like, a death threat
The critically acclaimed composer, stand over
Whichever mute miniscule mike holder
You never knew the real before, yo I show ya
You need to make your thoughts more sober, think it over
