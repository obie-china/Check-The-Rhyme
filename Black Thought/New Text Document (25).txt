Black Thought
Check it out now, its the type cerebral
World renowned, illustrious, ille-gal
My musical affection, bubbling within your zone
Like champagne, known as the Fifth campaign
Thought be doin his damn thang
Bent like, a boomerang, trying to maintain
I both yin and yang from Mi Kan Lang
What your lady getting me up? I never answering
Let her miss me, see me then she off trying to kiss me
Talkin bout, "I dig you Tariq, the way you twist me"
Meanwhile, she comin home tipsy, all grinning
And what you used to fit em before, you now swimming
Just take a dive P-5 deep, the team winning
Takin hip-hop back to, the beginnin
Cause M C are pretending, I slap your sound
Out the sky like I goaltending, bring your career
To an endin, enter the next era trascending for real
Knahmsaying? If not, then man listen
For you to try to fuck with the Fifth, thats ambition
I let yall know the time indeed, yall need to-
