Black Thought
Hey yo, I just a lyricist, a chemist of the hemp
The beat pimp, the ill Philly resident
Thats far from hesitant, corrupt like a President
Never benevolent but poetically prevalent
Cooler than peppermint
The Lieutenant for niggas talkin bout represent
No doubt, its obviously evident I get bent
Far from temporary son I very permanent
Hitting M C like an intoxicant, sent to prevent
Monopoly is my intent, the means is what I invent
This mental murder pay the rent
Lyrically I the dominant ingredient, the swift extravagant
Smooth lubricant, down with the M-the-Ill-itant
Thats the sound of the Dynasty chant
We surround your camp, assuming the war stance
And bring it from the chest, now lets dance
