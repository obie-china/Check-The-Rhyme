Black Thought
Yo I in the eye of the storm, where the pressures on
And M C is dressed funny like a leprechaun
I chop rappers up like chicken szechuan
Sells a squads off like a slave auction
Aiyyo my zodiac sign read caution
On stage, I make your seed to an orphan
Yo, my age an algebraic equation
Niggas want some? I hit 'em wit' a portion
Son, The Fifth foursome, armed at the door son
M-illi-tilla, Dice Raw, quick draw son
You don't want no more son? That's when more come
And drag a nigga Erie Avenue to Oregon, you're all done
Ladies and gentlemen, select the weapon at the
Gate upon entering, The Roots instrumentaling
Spark shit, them niggas try to talk shit
We hit 'em like the L at sixtieth and Market
South Philly clip a hole into a nigga pocket
Take sneaks, chains and rings and bracelets
Split back this like we the therapist
Adrenaline, Fifth mike terrorist, once again
