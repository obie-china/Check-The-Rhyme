Black Thought
Check it out, youre now intuned to the sounds of the
R to the, double-O to the, T-S and I stretch limit to this profession
My voice physically fit, tracks I bench-pressing
The mike chord is an extension of my intestine
Delicate M C sliced in my delicatessen
My mind state is that of the S-P
Connection, Pennsy a part of me, South Philly through my arteries
Thought the dark one, fearsome, slump son
My vocal just a knuckle that sucker punched the drum
Hip-hop, yo, thats my hustle and it kill a kingdom
That Fall Apart to drastic proportion
Lost ones out there, you better stand clear
The Fifth Dynasty, it be a world premiere
Cutting through, like attorneys at law thats car chasing
You star gazing, but the force yall facing' is the
R-to the, double-O to the, T-S an'
Yall niggas in the mix, keep guessing
The world traveller in the flesh without question
Last seven years on tour without resting
Yo the kind of rapper you should reconsider testing
Supreme simply, o-fficial Dundee
What I bringll motivate to move your whole country
Throw your hands up if yall want me to proceed wit
And carry out strategic plans to leave wit
The title that I watching', Roots we runting
My Dundee attire for M C hunting
Step up and out the ring
Yall niggas on some other, yall loud as Don King
But wine drink within the danger zone lounging
You need to be more aware of your surroundings
Reality at times is astounding enough to get your heart pounding
Its safe to assume, in all confidence
That I one of the illest in the seven continents
Yo, you on my dick, thanks for the compliments
You be fucked up by my Table of Contents
Bad Lieutenant, you I been rhyming since
The fucking past tense, fuck no delaying
Or playin taking your wing way back in the day of yo
Motherfucking' mind
